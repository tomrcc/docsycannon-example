      A technical documentation site is a website that your users can visit to
      find the documentation for your technical project. Your documentation set
      contains all the information you think your users might need to engage
      with your project, from overviews that help them understand what the
      project is for, to instructions for specific tasks. Depending on the size
      of the project, a documentation set can be a page or two or an entire
      “book” with different types of information.


      **Most users don’t want to have to spend much time looking at docs - they
      want to try your great project!**&nbsp;So how do you make sure your
      technical documentation set gives users what they need to easily
      understand your project and get things done? We think a good technical
      documentation set should be:


      * **Reliable**\: Is it true?

      * **Comprehensive**\: Does it have all the information your target users
      might need?

      * **Well-organized and navigable**\: Can the user find the information
      they need? Are similar types of information (all the information about a
      feature, all your reference information) grouped together?


      If you have users around the world, you might also want to provide your
      content in multiple languages, and if you have an open source project,
      you’ll probably want your users to be able to contribute to the docs.


      Once you have your content, you use a technical documentation site to
      publish your technical documentation set online for your users. In
      addition to your documentation, your site might also contain material like
      contact information, a blog, or information about how to contribute to the
      project.
